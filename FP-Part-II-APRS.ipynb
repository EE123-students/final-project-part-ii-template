    "In this part of the project we are going to experiment with digital modulation and communication. Network communication systems have layered architechtures. The bottom layer is the physical layer which implements the modulation. Here we will use your [AFSK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying) modules that you implemented in Lab 4 Part I. In addition, we will leverage [AX.25](http://www.tapr.org/pub_ax25.html), which is an amateur-radio data-link layer protocol. [AX.25](http://www.tapr.org/pub_ax25.html) is a packet based protocol that will help us transmit data using packets. It implements basic synchronization, addressing, data encapsulation and some error detection.  In the ham world, an implementation of AFSK and [AX.25](http://www.tapr.org/pub_ax25.html)  together is also called a [TNC ( Terminal Node Controller )](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_node_controller). In the past, TNCs were separate boxes that hams attached to their radios to communicate with packet-based communication. An example is [TNC-X](http://tnc-x.com). Today, it is easy to implement TNCs in software using the Raspberry Pi and a sound extension.... as you will see here! \n",

    "Since we can't guarantee that everyone will have access to a radio, a callsign, and an APRS IGate close enough for the attenuated radios to reach, we have adjusted this lab to emulate RF infrastructure with a popular software TNC called direwolf. Since direwolf was designed to be able to transmit and receive RF signals through a sound card, we can emulate an RF channel by connecting our code's transmissions to direwolf through the same audio loopback we used in Lab 4. This section will set up direwolf and the audio loopback."

    "AX.25 does not encode  NRZ '1's and '0's in the usual mark and space frequencies. Instead it uses a scheme called NRZI, or non-return to zero inverted.  NRZI encodes a '0' bit as a change from mark to space, or space to mark. A '1' is encoded as no change.  To encode an AX.25 packet we need to convert our bit sequence to an NRZI one.  For example, an original bit stream of 11011000 should be first converted to 11000101 (initial state is 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bit Stuffing\n",
    "Because a '1' is represented by no change, sending a long string of '1's would result in a constant signal. Receivers, similar to the one you designed in Lab 4, uses phase-locked-loops to synchronize on bit changes. So a long constant signal may result in a receiver drifting out of sync with the transmitter. In order to circumvent this, the encoder performs bit stuffing before transmition by placing   a bit '0' after every fifth '1' in the the stream. The decoder does bit unstuffing and removes the extra '0's. Bit stuffing is performed before converting to NRZI.\n",

The flag is an exception in which no bit stuffing is performed. Therefore it is the only place in the packet in which 6 consecutive '1's appear. In NRZI it will translate to a time interval of 7 bits between zero-crossings of the non-coherent detector output.  This means that we can use the flag sequence to uniquely detect the beginning and the end of a packet. \n",

This is similar to UDP in concept (however UDP is a transport layer protocol).\n",

    "## Automatic Positioning and Reporting System (APRS) (information from: [Here](http://www.aprs.org/doc/APRS101.PDF) and [here](http://www.aprs.org/iss-aprs/issicons.html))\n",
    "APRS is a ham packet-based system for real-time tactical digital communication for local area. APRS uses the AX.25 protocol in its core. Using APRS you can report position, status, and send messages that other hams or stations with APRS capability will be able to decode, interpret and display the information. APRS also provides means of packet repeating (Digipeaters) alongside internet terminal nodes. Some radio manufacturers saw the potential and included APRS in some of their products as well. Go to [this website](https://aprs.fi) to see the APRS activity in the surrounding area that is aggregated from the internet nodes. You will see fixed stations, weather stations, and mobile operators in your area. We will use the website to confirm that our transmitted packets were received. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Frequencies\n",
    "The national APRS frequency is 144.39MHz (ch-99 on your radio). There is much activity and infrastracture transmitting and listenning to that frequency. The international space station also has an APRS digipeater on board operating at 145.825MHZ (ch-50 on your radio). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### EE123 APRS frequency\n",
    "To prevent interference with others while we experiment with APRS, I have set up an APRS station in Cory hall. It will monitor the XPMT4U channel (ch-78),  443.670MHz on your radio. It has an internet link as well. Use this frequency especially if you are present in Cory Hall. If you are far from campus, this may not work. In that case, switch to the APRS frequency 144.39 (ch-99). Check out the website (http://aprs.fi) to see if there are any internet nodes near your home.\n",

    "\n",
    "For APRS packets, the Destination Address field is not used for routing. Instead it represents the version of the APRS software you are using. In order to be decoded by receivers in the APRS network it must start with the letters AP. We will use **`APCAL`** just for fun. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Source Address is **your call sign**. The Digipeater Addresses require some explanation, but the fields 'WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1' will result in the packet being digipeated a maximum of 2 hops. Using 'WIDE1-1' will result in a single hop which, in dense population areas like the Bay Area, is enough to get your packet to its destination. The Control and ID fields in APRS packets are fixed to \"\\x03\" and \"\\xF0\" respectively. The FCS field is the checksum field that is used to verify the packet integrity, as defined by AX.25. The flag fields are the usual 01111110.\n",
    "\n",

These implement several \"fun\" and useful services. For example, you can send a position report that would show up on a google map.
